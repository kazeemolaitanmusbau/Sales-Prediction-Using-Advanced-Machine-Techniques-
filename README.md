## Introduction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict future sales. Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for inventory management, budgeting, and strategic planning. By utilizing advanced machine learning models, this project aims to provide reliable sales predictions to help businesses make informed decisions.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict sales based on historical data and various features.
- **Techniques Used**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Models Explored**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data, including features such as date, store, item, promotions, holidays, and other relevant attributes. The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.

## Features

Sure, here is the rewritten version of the provided content:

- **Id**: Represents a unique (Store, Date) combination within the dataset.
- **Store**: A unique identifier for each store.
- **Sales**: The revenue generated on a given day (dependent variable).
- **Customers**: The number of customers visiting the store on a given day.
- **Open**: Indicates whether the store was open (1) or closed (0).
- **StateHoliday**: Indicates a state holiday. Typically, most stores are closed on state holidays, with some exceptions. All schools are closed on public holidays and weekends. Values can be: 
  - 'a': Public holiday
  - 'b': Easter holiday
  - 'c': Christmas
  - '0': None
- **SchoolHoliday**: Indicates if the (Store, Date) was affected by public school closures.
- **StoreType**: Differentiates between four store models: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'.
- **Assortment**: Describes the level of product assortment:
  - 'a': Basic
  - 'b': Extra
  - 'c': Extended
  - An assortment strategy in retailing involves the number and type of products available for purchase.
- **CompetitionDistance**: The distance in meters to the nearest competitor store.
- **CompetitionOpenSince [Month/Year]**: Provides the approximate month and year when the nearest competitor store opened.
- **Promo**: Indicates if the store is running a promotion on that day.
- **Promo2**: Indicates if the store is participating in a continuous promotion (Promo2):
  - '0': Store is not participating
  - '1': Store is participating
- **Promo2Since [Year/Week]**: Specifies the year and calendar week when the store started participating in Promo2.
- **PromoInterval**: Describes the months when Promo2 promotions are initiated, e.g., "Feb, May, Aug, Nov" means the promotion starts in February, May, August, and November each year for that store.

## Modeling

The project explores several machine learning models to find the best performer:

1. **Linear Regression**: A basic linear approach to understand the relationship between features and sales.
2. **Decision Trees**: A tree-based model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values.
3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
4. **Gradient Boosting**: An ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially to correct the errors of the previous ones.
5. **Neural Networks**: A deep learning approach to capture complex patterns in the data.

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics and is further tuned for optimal performance.
